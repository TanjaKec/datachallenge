It‚Äôs the first big hurdle to dealing with data in R. 

You are most likelly to have looked at, organised and examined your data files in Excel.

Opening data in R is fairly simply, but organising it for analysis might take some thought and consideration. You'll guess that it is possible to use **File | Import Dataset** menu option in RStudio to import your data, however we‚Äôre going to do it the proper way with a command.

There are many packages that let R import all types of data, but with the restriction of time in this bootcamp we will focus on `CSV` files and you can try to explore the rest for yourself.

Comma separated files are the most common way to save spreadsheets that don‚Äôt require a licenced, usually not free program to open. Importing `CSV` is part of base R and you can use `read.csv()` function to do so. 


##### `read.csv()`

Let us go to <https://data.gov.rs/> Serbian open data portal. In particular, let us try to access ["–ü–æ–¥–∞—Ü–∏ –∏–∑ –û–≥–ª–∞—Å–∞ —ò–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–±–∞–≤–∫–∏ —Å–∞ –ü–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª–∞ —ò–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–±–∞–≤–∫–∏"](https://data.gov.rs/sr/datasets/podatsi-iz-oglasa-javnikh-nabavki-sa-portala-javnikh-nabavki/) and import this data to R.

We are not going to download it onto our local computers, but rather we will import it to R directly from the web using the link.

```{r}
df_csv <- read.csv("http://portal.ujn.gov.rs/OpenD/Tekuci_Mesec.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(df_csv, 10)
```

The other way is to download it and to save it to your working directory.

Let us download ["–†–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç–∞—Ä –ø–æ–≤–ª–∞—á—õ–µ–Ω–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ—í–∞—á–∞ –µ–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—á–Ω–µ –µ–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏—ò–µ"](https://data.gov.rs/s/resources/registar-povlashtshenikh-proizvodjacha-elektrichne-energije/20170221-142908/povlasceni.csv) and save it on your computers.

Make sure you save the file into your R-Project working directory before you ask R to execute the following

```
df_csv <- read.csv("poslodavci.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

What do you think about this dataset?

##### readr::read_csv()

Just so you can see how easy it is to use other packages for importing data into R the code below illustrates the use of read_csv().

```
## If you don't have readr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
df_csv <- read_csv("poslodavci.csv")
df_csv
```

You can use R with appropriate packages to access other data formats. For example `jsonlite` package for `json` files or `foreign` package for `SPSS` data files. Try to look through the help of the packages you've been introduced to and discover other options.


## YOUR TURN üëá

1)	Open source software such as R and Git are extensively used in data science. Can you research the tools that are available for data science, both open and closed source. Write a short brief about the pros and cons for both types of software.

2)	Investigate the importance of open source data and identify where open source data can readily be found on the Internet. 

3) Write an explanation of the benefits of open source models for policy makings by local authorities and governments in general.

##### useful resource

`R osnove` by [dr Dejan B. Stojanovic](http://www.ilfe.org/sr/doc-dr-dejan-stojanovi%C4%87) is a book which  guides you to the world of statistical programming with R in an informative and easy to follow way. The book is written in Serbian and you can access it from [rzanat.rs](http://rzanat.rs/)
