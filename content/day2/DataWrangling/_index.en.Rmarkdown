### How do we do it? 🤔

![Red variant](/day2/DataWrangling/images/Program_HW.png?width=40pc)

This diagram is taken from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/statgarrett
) and [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), which it is a great resource for learning R. There is a whole community built around it and you could join it and start learning together: [R4DS online learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/).

### Dataset

To learn and practise how to organise a data we will use a `gapminder` data set available from `gapminder` package in R. This dataset is put into R by [Jennifer Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) from a tank of data sets available from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org).

[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org) is an independent Swedish foundation that helps to promote sustainable global development by collecting and analysiing relevant data and by developing and designing  teaching/learning tools. [Gapminder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapminder_Foundation) was founded in Sweden by [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) who was a mastermind for distinctive and insightful storytelling about global development using visual animation.

You can see Hans in action in this [BBC documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02q33dg) [The joy of Stats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdf0k545yDA) available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

##### Gapminder Data

For each of 142 countries, the package provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.

Before you can take a look at this data set first run the folowing code

```
# install necessary packages:
install.packages("dplyr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("gapminder", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("DT", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
#
# have a look at the data through a table
DT::datatable(head(gapminder::gapminder, 10))
```

{{% notice note %}}
💡 Note thet there are 6 columns, each of which we call a variable.
{{% /notice %}}

**Description**: Excerpt of the Gapminder data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.

The main data frame gapminder has **1704 rows** and **6 variables**:
- **country**: factor with 142 levels
- **continent**: factor with 5 levels
- **year**: ranges from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years
- **lifeExp**: life expectancy at birth, in years
- **pop**: population
- **gdpPercap**: GDP per capita

```{r}
gapminder::gapminder[1:3,]
```

1st look at the data using the following functions: <span style="color:red">`dim()`</span> & <span style="color:dim">`head()`</span>

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
head(gapminder, n=10)
```

Can you tell what each of the two functions does⁉️

Do we have the information about the structure of the data? 🤔 We can examine the structure using <span style="color:red">`str()`</span> function, but the **output could look messy** and hard to follow if the data set is big. 🤪

```{r}
str(gapminder) 
```

#### The `dplyr` Package

The <span style="color:red">**`dplyr`**</span> provides a “grammar” (the verbs) for data manipulation and for operating on data frames in a tidy way. The key operator and the essential verbs are:

<span style="color:red">%>%</span>: the “pipe” operator used to connect multiple verb actions together into a pipeline.

<span style="color:red">select()</span>: return a subset of the columns of a data frame.

<span style="color:red">mutate()</span>: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables.

<span style="color:red">filter()</span>: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions.

<span style="color:red">arrange()</span>: reorder rows of a data frame according to single or multiple variables.

<span style="color:red">summarise() / summarize()</span>: reduce each group to a single row by calculating aggregate measures.

We can have a look at the data and its structure by using the <span style="color:red">`glimpse()`</span> function from the `dplyr` package.

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
glimpse(gapminder) 
```

🤓💡: Notice how we could prevent display of the messages that appear when uploading the packages by using, in this case, `suppressPackageStartupMessages()`!

Now we have the `dplyr` package uploaded, let us learn its verbs. 😇

#### The pipeline operater: <span style="color:red">`%>%`</span>

**Left Hand Side (LHS)**   <span style="color:red">`%>%`</span>    **Right Hand Side (RHS)**

<span style="color:red">x %>% f(..., y)</span> 

<span style="color:red">    f(x,y)</span>

The "pipe" **passes the result of the *LHS as the 1st operator argument of the function on the RHS**.

<pre>
<span style="color:red">3 %>% sum(4)</span>      <==>      <span style="color:red">  sum(3, 4)</span>
</pre>

<span style="color:red">`%>%`</span> is very practical for chaining together multiple <span style="color:red">`dplyr`</span> functions in a sequence of operations.

#### Pick variables by their names: <span style="color:red">`select()`</span>,

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/select().png")
```

- <span style="color:red">`starts_with("X")`</span> every name that starts with "X".

- <span style="color:red">`ends_with("X")`</span> every name that ends with "X".

- <span style="color:red">`contains("X")`</span> every name that contains "X".

- <span style="color:red">`matches("X")`</span> every name that matches "X", where "X" can be a regular expression.

- <span style="color:red">`num_range("x", 1:5)`</span>  the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04, x05.

- <span style="color:red">`one_of(x)`</span> => every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.

##### 👉 Practice ⏰💻: Select your variables 

1) that ends with letter `p`

2) starts with letter `co`. Try to do this selection using base R.  

##### 😃🙌 Solutions:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm_pop_gdp <- select(gapminder, ends_with("p"))
head(gm_pop_gdp, n = 1)
gm_cc <- select(gapminder, starts_with("co"))
head(gm_cc, n = 1)
```

of course all of this could be done using **base R** for example:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm_cc <- gapminder[c("country", "continent")]
```

but it's less intuitive and often requires more typing. 

#### Create new variables of existing variables: <span style="color:red">`mutate()`</span>

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mutate().png")
```

It would allow you to add to the data frame `df` a new column, `z`, which is the multiplication of the columns `x` and `y`: `mutate(df, z = x * y)`.
If we would like to observe `lifeExp` measured in months we could create a new column `lifeExp_month`: 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder2 <- mutate(gapminder, LifeExp_month = lifeExp * 12) 
head(gapminder2, n = 2)
```

#### Pick observations by their values: <span style="color:red">`filter()`</span>
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/filter().png")
```

There is a set of logical operators in **R** that you can use inside `filter()`:

- `x < y`: `TRUE` if `x` is less than `y`
- `x <= y`: `TRUE` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`
- `x == y`: `TRUE` if `x` equals `y`
- `x != y`: `TRUE` if `x` does not equal `y`
- `x >= y`: `TRUE` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`
- `x > y`: `TRUE` if `x` is greater than `y`
- `x %in% c(a, b, c)`: `TRUE` if `x` is in the vector `c(a, b, c)`
- `is.na(x)`:  Is `NA`
- `!is.na(x)`: Is not `NA`

##### 👉 Practice ⏰💻: Filter your data

Use `gapminder2` `df` to filter:

1) only European countries and save it as `gapmEU`

2) only European countries from 2000 onward and save it as `gapmEU21c`

3) rows where the life expectancy is greater than 80

Don't forget to **use `==` instead of `=`**! and
Don't forget the quotes **`""`**


##### 😃🙌 Solutions:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU <- filter(gapminder2, continent == "Europe") 
head(gapmEU, 2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU21c <- filter(gapminder2, continent == "Europe" & year >= 2000)
head(gapmEU21c, 2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
filter(gapminder2, lifeExp > 80)
```

#### Reorder the rows: <span style="color:red">`arrange()`</span>
is used to reorder rows of a **d**ata **f**rame (df) according to one of the variables/columns.

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/arrange().png")
```

- If you pass `arrange()` a character variable, **R** will rearrange the rows in alphabetical order according to values of the variable. 

- If you pass a factor variable, **R** will rearrange the rows according to the order of the levels in your factor (running `levels()` on the variable reveals this order).

##### 👉 Practice ⏰💻: Arranging your data
1) Arrange countries in `gapmEU21c` `df` by life expectancy in ascending and descending order.

2) Using `gapminder df`
  - Find the records with the smallest population
  
  - Find the records with the largest life expectancy.

##### 😃🙌 Solution 1):
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU21c_h2l <- arrange(gapmEU21c, lifeExp)
head(gapmEU21c_h2l, 2)
gapmEU21c_l2h <- arrange(gapmEU21c, desc(lifeExp)) # note the use of desc()
head(gapmEU21c_l2h, 2)
```

##### 😃🙌 Solution 2):
```{r, echo = TRUE}
arrange(gapminder, pop)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
arrange(gapminder, desc(lifeExp))
```

#### Collapse many values down to a single summary: <span style="color:red">`summarise()`</span>

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/summarise().png")
```

- uses the same syntax as `mutate()`, but the resulting dataset consists of a single row instead of an entire new column in the case of `mutate()`. 

- builds a new dataset that contains only the summarising statistics.

##### 👉 Practice ⏰💻: Use `summarise()`:

1) to print out a summary of gapminder containing two variables: max_lifeExp and max_gdpPercap.

2) to print out a summary of gapminder containing two variables: mean_lifeExp and mean_gdpPercap.

##### 😃🙌 Solution: Summarise your data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summarise(gapminder, max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp), max_gdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summarise(gapminder, mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp), mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

#### Let's `%>%` all up!

You can try to get into a habit of using a shortcut for the pipe operator 
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pipe_short_cut.png")
```

##### 🗣👥 Confer with your neighbours: 
What relationship do you expect to see between population size (`pop`) and life expectancy (`lifeExp`)?

**Look what this code produces**

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.align = 'center'}
gapminder_pipe <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe" & year ==  2007) %>%
  mutate(pop_e6 = pop / 1000000)
plot(gapminder_pipe$pop_e6, gapminder_pipe$lifeExp, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
```

## YOUR TURN 👇

Practise by doing the following set of exercises:

1) Install and upload the `rattle` package and see what it does.

2) Create a new R script file to explore `weatherAUS` dataset. 

  i) `select()` variable: `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Rainfall` and `Sunshine` by *pipping* the dataset into `dplyr::select() function.
  
  ii) produce a *summary*  using `base::summary()` function of these numeric values.
  
  iii) within this selection filter only those observations where `Rainfall >= 1` and save the results into the computer's memory (ie. save the results as an object).
  
  iv) Try to think of how else you can use other `dplyr` verbs on this `weatherAUS` dataset. Write your question first, before embarking on typing the code.
  
  v) Write a short report on what visualisation you think would be interesting to produce for this `weatherAUS` dataset and why?
