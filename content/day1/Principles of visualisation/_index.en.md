## Designed to enable: exploration, discovery, communication

Graphical methods are commonly used for exploratory data analysis. Boxplots, scatterplot matrices, nonparametric smoothers and tree diagrams are just some of the mostly used graphical tools for data exploration. This part of the course will provide practical recommendation for choosing the best chart or graph type for creating good and clear graphics that would serve the purpose of communicating the key information 

1. to intended audience and the publication
2. to help readers answer the questions your graphic is showing
3. to understand it easy without reading every single figure
